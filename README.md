# [DSA] Advanced-Tree - Trie

You are asked to study the following tree data structure: Trie.

How to prepare your source code

• Implement the tree data structure trie that includes the following basic operations:

− Test whether a trie is empty.
− Get the number of items in a trie.
− Find the item in a trie.
− Insert a new item into the trie.
− Remove an item from the trie.
− Build a trie from given items.
− Remove all elements from the trie.


• Consider a mini dictionary of English words, which is stored in a text file of following format.

− First line: a positive integer N, indicating the number of words.
− N next lines: each single line shows an English word.

Build a trie from the given dictionary.

• There is no restriction on how to organize the code. In the main function, provide code to show
the trie built from the given dictionary and some examples of looking up words in the trie.
How to prepare your report

• Consider an empty trie of strings. Show, step by step, how the trie changes while experiencing
a series of item insertion and deletion.

• Report the time complexity for each of the above basic operations.

• Identify the presence of trie in practical applications.
